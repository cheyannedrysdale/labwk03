# Command Line: Basics Everyone Should Know

If you don't own a computer in the year 2024, you might actually live under a rock. In which case I would suggest changing that, immediately. But if you ARE a computer owner, having some general knowledge about how to operate the command-line interface within it can prove to be very beneficial for you. Here are a few specific examples where operating the command-line comes in handy, which I'm sure everyone would appreciate being aware of:


- when an app is not responding, and you need to restart it
- it allows you to quickly navigate through files & directories 
- if you own multiple computers, it allows you remote access to control them, automate tasks, and perform system maintenance
- if used in public, it can make you look like a hacker-genius (to the untrained eye, of course :wink: )

Listed below are some basic command-line prompts to help you get started.
